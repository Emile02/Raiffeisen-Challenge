# Raiffeisen-Project
If last year’s events have affected us in many ways, they have also shown that although social distancing was and still is in place, people always find a way to stay connected. New and creative digital solutions have emerged and Banque Raiffeisen would like to take this opportunity to offer its members a community platform in order for them to share their ideas and continue help shape the bank’s future.


Your challenge will be to present an innovative idea based on a digital platform that will be able to gather the bank and its community around local projects and products. Feel free to integrate all open-source technology and services able to support your innovative platform concept.
Let the game begin!

 

Take on Raiffeisen’s Challenge to have a chance to win a Grand Prize of €5000 as well as prizes of €2000 and €1000 for the 2nd and 3rd place winners, respectively.

Are you up to the challenge?
